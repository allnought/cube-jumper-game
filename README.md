## Cube Jumper Game
*Developed with Zig 0.9.1* 

This is a very simple still in development platformer game written in [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) with the [raylib graphics library](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master) utilizing bindings by [ryupold](https://github.com/ryupold/raylib.zig). It's not intended to be played recreationally but is simply a personal project for me to better understand the language and library in the hopes of achieving better proficiency. There are therefore also going to be many major issues in the code and the general implementation of many things, but hopefully, making these mistakes now means they won't be made later.
